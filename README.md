> Authentication API Scaffolding

## Info
This is my first API project. I you have any clues for me on security or anything else, please let me know.

## Known issues
- `objection-unique` does not work with `objection@1.0.0`. Will write my own uniqueness check for Objection.js.
- `created_at` and `updated_at` don't include the dates.
