# auth-api

Scaffolding for a user authentication API with JSON WebTokens. Uses Sequelize ORM to communicate to a database, to change that, I highly recommend reading their docs.

**This is my first project in the direction API building. If I did anything wrong or you got some sneaky tips, let me know.**
